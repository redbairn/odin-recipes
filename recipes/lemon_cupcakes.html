   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Here is a lemon cupcake recipe I use for beautifully delicious treats. Ideally, you'd use buttercream frosting to top the cupcakes, but I tried these with lemon cream icing for a less buttery option, and they were perfect! These cupcakes are truly lighter than air and will melt in your mouth.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Cupcakes:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk, divided</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Lemon Cream Icing:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups chilled heavy cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 30 cupcake pan cups with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Prepare the cupcakes: Sift flour and salt together in a bowl. Beat butter and sugar together in another bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add in eggs one at a time, beating after each addition to incorporate. Mix in lemon zest and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Gently beat flour mixture into butter mixture, 1/3 at a time, alternating with 1/2 of the milk and 1/2 of the lemon juice after each of the first two additions of flour. Beat until just combined; do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Fill the prepared cupcake liners with batter, 3/4 full, and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 17 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool in the pans before removing them to finish cooling on a rack, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the icing: Beat cream in a chilled bowl with an electric mixer set on low until cream begins to thicken. Add confectioners' sugar and lemon juice, a little at a time, beating after each addition, until fully incorporated. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat until the icing forms soft peaks, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread icing on cooled cupcakes. Refrigerate leftovers.</li>
    </ol>
